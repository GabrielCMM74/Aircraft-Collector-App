You can view your aircraft, upload images, manage a fuel system with a built in calendar, and an updated statement appears once you have fueled 3 times in one day. You are also able to create a list of aircrafts, each with different services, and delete as neccesary. In order to access your personal portfolio you must sign in with your personal log in you set up for security and privacy compliance.
